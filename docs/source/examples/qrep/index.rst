Quantum relative entropy programming
======================================

Here, we outline examples of quantum relative entropy programs which arise in
quantum information theory, which we organized into the following categories.

        How to can compute the quantum key rate for a given quantum
        cryptographic protocol. 

    .. grid-item-card:: Nearest matrix

        Finding the closest matrix to a given matrix in the quantum relative
        entropy sense.

    .. grid-item-card:: Quantum channels

        Explores the fundamental limits of communication with quantum
        resources.

        Some examples involving operator relative entropies and weighted 
        geometric means.
